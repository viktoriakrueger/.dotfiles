# If you want to synchronize calcurse with a CalDAV server using
# calcurse-caldav, create a new directory at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calcurse/caldav/
# (~/.config/calcurse/caldav/) and $XDG_DATA_HOME/calcurse/caldav/
# (~/.local/share/calcurse/caldav/) and copy this file to
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calcurse/caldav/config and adjust the configuration below.
# Alternatively, if using ~/.calcurse, create a new directory at
# ~/.calcurse/caldav/ and copy this file to ~/.calcurse/caldav/config and adjust
# the configuration file below.
