:s/foo/bar/	replace the first match of 'foo' with 'bar' on the current line only
:s/foo/bar/g	replace all matches (`g` flag) of 'foo' with 'bar' on the current line only
:%s/foo/bar/g	replace all matches of 'foo' with 'bar' in the entire file (`:%s`)
:%s/foo/bar/gc	ask to manually confirm (`c` flag) each replacement
:5,12s/foo/bar/g	Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from line 5 to line 12 (inclusive).

# Preceding a motion or edition with a number repeats it 'n' times
# Examples:
50k         moves 50 lines up
2dw         deletes 2 words
5yy         copies 5 lines
42G         go to line 42

# Cases

~            Toggle case of the character under the cursor, or all visually-selected characters.
3~           Toggle case of the next three characters.
g~3w         Toggle case of the next three words.
g~iw         Toggle case of the current word (inner word â€“ cursor anywhere in word).
g~$          Toggle case of all characters to end of line.
g~~          Toggle case of the current line (same as V~).

The above uses ~ to toggle case. In each example, you can replace ~ with u to convert to lowercase, or with U to convert to uppercase. For example:

U           Uppercase the visually-selected text. First press v or V then move to select text. If you dont select text, pressing U will undo all changes to the current line.
gUU         Change the current line to uppercase (same as VU).
gUiw        Change current word to uppercase.
u           Lowercase the visually-selected text. If you dont select text, pressing u will undo the last change.
guu         Change the current line to lowercase (same as Vu).
