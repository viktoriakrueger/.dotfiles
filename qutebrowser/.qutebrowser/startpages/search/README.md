## Description

Responsive D3.js startpage that we kluged together by appending hrefs to nodes of a force directed graph. 

## Usage

Use it as a local startpage or utilize our hosted version. All styles are inline, so you can just run the .html file. Include the .ttf file in the same directory if you want the 8 bit font. 
l0bster added full responsiveness to the page without the search bar. uncomment it out and delete the search bar if you want that.

Reference your browser documentation to set it as your startpage. 

## modification

- colors : modify the rgb values in the colors array (group is correlated with node color). 
- links: modify the urls in the nodes object array
- postions: modify the sources and targets to change which node links to which
- gravity: just like real life, its how much force is pushing down the svg 
- charge: the amount of oposing force each node exerts on the other nodes ( like trying to push two north poles of a magnet together)
- linkDistance: the length of the svg lines that link the nodes. 

## misc

Clone it, Fork it, shamelessly copy whatever you want!
