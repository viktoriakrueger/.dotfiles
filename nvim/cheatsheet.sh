:s/foo/bar/	replace the first match of 'foo' with 'bar' on the current line only
:s/foo/bar/g	replace all matches (`g` flag) of 'foo' with 'bar' on the current line only
:%s/foo/bar/g	replace all matches of 'foo' with 'bar' in the entire file (`:%s`)
:%s/foo/bar/gc	ask to manually confirm (`c` flag) each replacement

# Examples:
50k         moves 50 lines up
2dw         deletes 2 words
5yy         copies 5 lines
42G         go to line 42
