# [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

Bash is the GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell. This is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.

**I use bash to load the desktop environment in arch linux. For a comfortable shell I recommend [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)**
